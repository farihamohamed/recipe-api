we are going all the way to ethiopia
today and we
are going to be making durowatt for
those who don't know
dora what is an onion-based spicy
fragrance and delicious chicken stew and
it's usually
served over injera which is a type of
spongy flat bread
which is also a favorite in eutopia
for this recipe we are going to be using
a handful of
ingredients but not to worry i have
listed all the ingredients with their
measurements
down there for you in the description
box below
so be sure to check that out this recipe
calls for
red onions and as you can see i've got
four large bulbs of
red onions here with me ideally what we
are supposed to do
is to use a sharp knife and patiently
mince this onion and when i say mince i
mean
finely minced however i like to make
things
a little easier in the kitchen so what i
do is just to cut this onion
into big chunks and then i pour
everything
inside my food processor and i use
the pulse button to process it a couple
of times
until i get my desired finish
as you can see these onions are well
minced
so now i'm going to be adding these
minced onions
inside my pot i'm using a large pot for
this
and this is what you need don't make a
mistake of using a small
pot because you might have to change the
pot in between the cooking process
and we are going to be cooking this down
on a low heat
we want it to simmer down no rush at all
and this is going to take anywhere from
40 minutes to one hour
so while this is cooking down i'm going
to be
processing my chicken ideally when
making
durowatt we are supposed to use a whole
chicken
and divide that into 12 pieces
and that is going to represent the 12
tribes
of jacob this is quite an interesting
recipe
however i don't have any whole chicken
in the house today what i have
is drumsticks so feel free to use
any part of chicken you want for this
recipe
i know the chicken breasts also work
just as well
so what i'm doing right now is just
peeling off the skin
of the chicken once the chicken
drumsticks have been nicely peeled
the next thing is to add some water and
vinegar
over this chicken and this water vinegar
solution
is not only going to clean this chicken
but it's also going to help to tenderize
the chicken so we are going to be
leaving this to soak
while we are cooking down the onions
[Music]
our onion is cooking really nice
and good and don't forget we have to be
steering this
every now and then in order to prevent
burning
so i'm going to cover this again and
come back to it and stir it again
back and forth like that until we reach
our desired
consistency a good way to know that the
onions
are ready is when they begin to stick to
the bottom of the pot
that's the first clue then the second
clue is the color
as you can see the color is looking like
a dark pink hair
it has changed from that bright color to
this
so at this point we know we are ready to
move on to the next step
for the next step i'm just going to be
cleaning my chicken thoroughly
we are going to wash with the vinegar
and rinse them
a couple of times
[Music]
once that is done we are going to be
setting them
aside
[Music]
i'm now going to be adding my oil inside
my cooked down onion
and we are going to leave the onion to
cook with the oil for about a minute or
two
now add the minced garlic the minced
ginger
tomato paste beverage spice
and salt the beverage spice
is quite spicy because it contains
a lot of spicy pepper so that is why i
like to add
tomato paste inside my durawatt stew
to tone down the heat a little bit if
you like it's really hot
it's fine you can skip the tomato paste
the whole house is smelling really good
right now
but we are not yet done the next thing
is to add our chicken
inside the stew and i like to
give the chicken a couple of slashes so
that the stew
is going to be able to penetrate deeply
inside
the chicken you don't have to do this
it's just my own
way of making the chicken really absorb
the stew
[Music]
i'm also going to be adding some water
in here very little water
you don't want to go overboard because
this is
a thick stew also the chicken
in the stew is going to release its own
juices so we have to be careful with
the amount of liquid we add now cover
this up
and leave it to cook still on a low heat
while the chicken is boiling i'm going
to be
boiling my eggs i'm using about six eggs
today
but you can use more or less depending
on your preference
so here we go my steel has been
simmering for about
a whole hour now and my house smells
amazing but we are not yet done at this
point i'm going to be adding my
spiced clarified butter and if you don't
know what that is
i have also explained that for you in
the description box
or head on to my website you have all
the details you need for this
recipe there so now i'm also going to be
adding my
boiled eggs because you also want the
eggs to absorb
some of the flavors of this stew so we
leave the eggs to cook
inside the stew for about five to ten
minutes
and there we go our durawatt is ready
it's a long process but i tell you it's
really worth
the whole stress because at the end of
the day you are going to be
rewarded with this delicious stew and i
like to make it in excess
because it freezes very well you can
just
bring it out of the freezer and warm it
whenever you need it
when i make this stew i don't only serve
it with
injera i also serve it over rice
and its pairs perfectly well now you
don't really have to take me for my word
just try it and come back and tell me
about your experience
so that is it again for today thank you
very much for
spending your time with me until next
time
i'll talk to you shortly enjoy
